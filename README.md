Dynamic analysis of open-source package and applying machine learning for
malicious open-source packages detection

This repository contains the source code and data for the thesis title "Dynamic analysis of open-source package and applying machine learning for
malicious open-source packages detection." The objective of this thesis is to provide data analysis through dynamic analysis using an using an open source package named package-analysis.
The dataset is available in Google BigQuery. Further, this thesis aims to create a methodology to obtain malicious and benign packages and apply machine learning to automatically classify malicious open source packages.

In this repository, you can find:

* Thesis reports:
* Web application to automatically classify malicious npm packages based on results provided by package-analysis tools.
* Colab Note book for training and evaluating machine models.
* Dataset for malicious and benign packages.
